summary: How real-time alerts differ from the daily summary, and how to choose
  where you get them.

## Real-time alerts vs. Daily summary
- **Real-time alerts**: sent immediately when a matching request is posted.
- **Daily summary**: a once-per-day email with active requests.

## Channels
You can choose **Email**, **SMS**, or **Both** for real-time alerts. Daily summary is **email only**.

## Where to set preferences
1. Sign in at your main app.
2. Open **Dashboard â†’ Alert Preferences**.
3. Toggle **Real-time alerts** on/off.
4. For each route/topic, choose **Email / SMS / Both / None**.
5. Click **Save**.

## Tips
- No real-time alerts? Check that the route/topic is set to **Email** or **SMS** (not **None**).
- SMS delays can be carrier-related; email is usually instant.
