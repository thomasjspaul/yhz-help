When you first create an account, you **will not** be able to post requests or receive alerts.  



## Why Verification is Required
The purpose of YHZ Crew Alerts is to connect **verified crew members** only.  
We verify accounts to:
- Protect member information  
- Ensure only legitimate crew can access and use the system  
- Maintain a trusted environment for everyone  

This is a **one-time** step.



## How to Start Verification
You can begin verification by:
- Clicking the **Verify Now** buttons or links on your dashboard or request pages  
- Visiting **[yhz.app/activate](https://yhz.app/activate)** directly



## Verification Methods
You have two options:

### 1 — Send an Email from Your Work or ALPA Email
Send an email to **help@yhz.app** stating you wish to activate your account.  
Once confirmed, we’ll update your account to **verified**.



### 2 — Quick Verification (Almost Instant)
1. On the verification page, select your airline.  
2. Enter your **work email address**.  
3. A single-use code will be sent to your work email (check your **Inbox** and **Spam/Junk** folders).  
   - The email will come from **help@yhz.app**.  
4. Enter the code into the verification box and click **Activate**.  
5. Your account will be verified instantly, and your work email will be **deleted from our system**.



Once verified, you can:
- Post requests  
- Receive real-time alerts  
- Fully participate in YHZ Crew Alerts
